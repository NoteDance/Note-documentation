# attention
This module implements an attention layer, which can compute the context vector and the attention weights based on the query, value and key tensors. The usage of this module is as follows:

- First, create an instance of the attention class, and specify the use_scale and score_mode arguments. The use_scale argument indicates whether to use a scale factor for the score calculation. The score_mode argument indicates which mode to use for the score calculation, either "dot" or "concat". You can also specify the dtype argument, which is the data type of the tensors.
- Second, call the output method of the instance, and pass the query, value and key tensors as the query, value and key arguments. The query tensor has a shape of [batch_size, Tq, dim], where Tq is the query sequence length and dim is the dimensionality. The value and key tensors have a shape of [batch_size, Tv, dim], where Tv is the value/key sequence length. If you don't pass the key tensor, it will be assumed to be equal to the value tensor.
- The output method will return a tensor of shape [batch_size, Tq, dim], which is the attention output. It is computed by applying a softmax function to the score tensor of shape [batch_size, Tq, Tv], and then multiplying it with the value tensor.

For example:

```python
# Create an attention instance with use_scale=True and score_mode="dot"
att = attention(use_scale=True, score_mode="dot")
# Generate random query, value and key tensors of shape [batch_size, Tq/Tv, dim]
batch_size = 2
Tq = 3
Tv = 4
dim = 5
query = tf.random.normal([batch_size, Tq, dim])
value = tf.random.normal([batch_size, Tv, dim])
key = tf.random.normal([batch_size, Tv, dim])
# Call the output method with query, value and key as inputs
output = att.output(query, value, key)
# The output will have a shape of [2, 3, 5]
```

# separable_conv1d
This module implements a separable convolutional layer, which can apply a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution to an input tensor and produce a feature map. The usage of this module is as follows:

- First, create an instance of the separable_conv1d class, and specify the number of output filters, the kernel size, the depth multiplier, and other optional parameters such as input size, strides, padding mode, data format, dilation rate, weight initializer, bias initializer, activation function, use bias flag, and data type.
- Second, call the output method of the instance, and pass the input tensor as the data argument. The input tensor should be a three-dimensional tensor of shape [batch_size, length, channels], where batch_size is the number of samples in a batch, length is the dimension of the input sequence, and channels is the dimension of the input features.
- The output method will return a tensor of shape [batch_size, new_length, filters], where new_length is the dimension of the output sequence after applying the convolution operation, and filters is the number of output filters.

For example:

```python
# Create a separable convolution layer with 64 output filters, 5 kernel size, 2 depth multiplier
separable_conv1d = separable_conv1d(filters=64, kernel_size=5, depth_multiplier=2,input_size=16)
# Apply the separable convolution layer to a batch of input data of shape [32, 100, 16]
input_data = tf.random.normal([32, 100, 16])
output_data = separable_conv1d.output(input_data)
# The output_data will have a shape of [32, 96, 64]
```

# separable_conv2d
This module implements a separable convolutional layer, which can apply a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution to an input tensor and produce a feature map. The usage of this module is as follows:

- First, create an instance of the separable_conv2d class, and specify the number of output filters, the kernel size, the depth multiplier, and other optional parameters such as input size, strides, padding mode, data format, dilation rate, weight initializer, bias initializer, activation function, use bias flag, and data type.
- Second, call the output method of the instance, and pass the input tensor as the data argument. The input tensor should be a four-dimensional tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, channels], where batch_size is the number of samples in a batch, height and width are the dimensions of the input image, and channels is the dimension of the input features.
- The output method will return a tensor of shape [batch_size, new_height, new_width, filters], where new_height and new_width are the dimensions of the output image after applying the convolution operation, and filters is the number of output filters.

For example:

```python
# Create a separable convolution layer with 64 output filters, 5x5 kernel size, 2 depth multiplier
separable_conv2d = separable_conv2d(filters=64, kernel_size=[5, 5], depth_multiplier=2,input_size=3)
# Apply the separable convolution layer to a batch of input data of shape [32, 28, 28, 3]
input_data = tf.random.normal([32, 28, 28, 3])
output_data = separable_conv2d.output(input_data)
# The output_data will have a shape of [32, 24, 24, 64]
```
