# Gradient
This code defines a **Gradient** optimizer that uses the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function. The gradient descent algorithm updates the parameters by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient.

To use this optimizer, you need to create a **Gradient** object with one argument: **lr**. **lr** is the learning rate that controls the update size.

The optimizer has an **opt** method that takes two arguments: **gradient** and **parameter**. **gradient** is a list or tuple of tensors that are the loss gradients for the parameters. **parameter** is a list or tuple of tensors that are the parameters to update. The method returns the updated parameters.

The optimizer uses some TensorFlow functions, such as **nest.flatten**, **nest.pack_sequence_as**, and **state_ops.assign**. These functions are used to flatten and pack nested structures, and assign values to tensors.
