Pool net:
Pool net use multithreading parallel and random add episode in pool,which would make data being uncorrelated in pool,
then pools would be used parallel training agent.
Each thread have a pool.
Note have two types of pool net.

First type:
Each thread number would save in list that is abstract.

Second type:
Each thread number would save in matrix that is abstract.

It also can be realized by higher dimension,but i haven't realized.

Stop mechanism has been perfected.(PO1)

Support prioritized replay.

Support pool parallelism.

Support gradient attenuation.
